I am a second-year postgraduate in Computer Science and Technology in [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof.Yusheng LIU](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/ysliu/). I received my Bachelor's Degree at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in 2022.

I'm looking for summer research or anytime research intern in order to apply for a Ph.D. in Computer Science in the fall of 2025.

Research
======
My recent research is about Model-Based Systems Engineering ([MBSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_systems_engineering)), which is an early phase of Computer Aided Design(CAD), using Artificial Intelligence, called AI4SE. 

My research interests are Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, especially 3D models. And I have learned related courses and required relevant skills. 

I have enough time to continuously and fully engage in research that interests me. I would like to collaborate with you if you have any intriguing ideas. Let's create and do something interesting.
